## File Encryption/Decryption with integrated file explorer in Rust
Project start date: 2.11.2023

## About the project
Project completed by analysing and using the code from another repo and to eventually add my own functionality.
Its purpose is to get better about the ideas behind functional programming and practice them to be able to write next project completely by myself 
#### Feature 1: Truth Table Generation
The core feature of this project is Truth Table Generation. With this application you can generate truth table for any logic formula in mathematical and written form.

## User Manual
- Format: alphabetic characters and operators = Or, And, Implies, Equal, Not
### Examples
- In: `Or p q`
- Out:
```
----------------------
 | p | q | ('p'v'q') |
 ------------
 | F | F | F |
 ------------
 | F | T | T |
 ------------
 | T | F | T |
 ------------
 | T | T | T |
```



## Why Haskell?
The decision to adopt Haskell for this project stems from a desire to learn functional programming. Haskell serves as an ideal platform to work on this goal.
By choosing Haskell, the project aligns with my personal goal of mastering programming concepts. Haskell's emphasis on immutability, pure functions, and strong type system provides an excellent environment to grasp the fundamental principles of functional programming.
